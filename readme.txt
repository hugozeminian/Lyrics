Assignment 2: Lyrics
Overview
Write a stylesheet to make a lyrics page that matches the style shown.
Directions
Download the assignment package which includes an HTML file and image for a lyrics page. The
package also includes a PDF showing a styled version of the same page. Create a stylesheet that
changes the given page to match the style shown in the PDF.
You can write the style either as an internal stylesheet in the head section of the HTML file, or
as an external stylesheet that the HTML file links. You can make other minor changes to the
HTML file if needed, but note that no major changes are needed to complete this assignment.
Most of your work should be focused on writing CSS. You may add an id or class to some
elements, but do not write any inline styles.
Post the completed page on your web server and submit the page on D2L along with the
address of your page on your web server.
